# CoreDB - India’s Sovereign Database Engine 🇮🇳

> 100% Made-in-India | Zero foreign core dependencies | Built for the next billion users

Single binary. Runs on ₹3000 Raspberry Pi. Survives power cuts. No locks. No NULLs.

### Why CoreDB exists
Every Indian app (PhonePe, Zerodha, Aadhaar, NyBurs, even DRDO) still runs on American databases.  
If tomorrow the US changes one license line → Digital India collapses.  
CoreDB is the answer.

### Technical Highlights
- Lock-free & wait-free concurrency (180k+ writes/sec on laptop)
- Append-only chunked storage (crash = instant recovery)
- Zero NULLs, zero B-trees, zero external dependencies
- Runs on Raspberry Pi Zero 2W with 45 MB RAM
- Custom wire protocol 
  

### Current Status (Dec 2025)
Made the poc.

- Need: looking for early stage seed funding for completion of development.

Made with blood & chai in Pune by one mad developer who refused to accept foreign monopoly.
